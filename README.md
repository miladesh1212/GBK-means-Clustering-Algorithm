# GBK-means-Clustering-Algorithm
Welcome. This repository contains the matlab based implementation of the 'GBK-means Clustering Algorithm: An improvement to the K-means algorithm based on the Bargaining Game'. In this repository, source codes of GBK-means Clustering Algorithm and its comparisons with two well-knowed clustering algorithms, K-means and fuzzy cmeans, are presented. Comparisons have been made on artificial and real world data sets with regard to Common validity indexes. Proposed approach is a new mechanism for addressing cluster analysis problem in wich cluster centers compete with each other to attract the largest number of similar objectives or entities to their cluster.
